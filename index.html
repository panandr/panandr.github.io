I served as a Senior, Lead Engineer and as a Team Leader in the DNS department, with notable achievements including:
- Led the implementation of an alerting platform enabling customers to set alerts for key events, ensuring availability of critical components like the DNS zone transfer subsystem for reliable data replication across DNS deployments.
- Developed a Real-User-Measurement data ingestion pipeline for our [Traffic Steering](https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-to-optimize-application-performance-with-ns1-traffic-steering/) system (>10K req/sec).
- Led end-to-end execution of projects, from architecture design to implementation, deployment, and monitoring, including the [DNSSEC](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/aiops/blogs/nathanael-jean-francois/2023/10/03/ns1s-journey-to-dnssec) service, the [Zone Version](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ns1-connect?topic=zones-zone-versioning-backup-restore) service, the [Monitoring](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ns1-connect?topic=monitoring-managing-ns1-jobs) service.
- Improved the database and API performance (100-1000x) by analyzing and optimizing PostgreSQL bottlenecks.
- Served as incident commander in multiple (>10) SEV1 incidents.
- Developed full-stack features while introducing new technologies to strengthen our architecture, such as Kafka, Debezium, PostgreSQL as a queue, refactoring monoliths to micro-services and more.
- Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams‚ÄîProduct, Frontend, Design, and QA‚Äîto drive success across multiple initiatives while facilitating cross-team collaboration to address critical issues and ensure smooth operations.
- Mentored and onboarded 6 new team members, fostering growth and development within the team.
