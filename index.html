# **Dimitrios Mavrommatis**
## **Profile Summary**
I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in backend development and site reliability engineering. I've led teams in architecting scalable, high-performance systems, particularly focusing on Kubernetes and multi-cluster environments. I'm skilled in strategic leadership and mentoring, and I'm passionate about delivering cost-effective and resilient systems. I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can lead backend and infrastructure teams to build scalable systems that drive business success.

## **Career Highlights**
- **Open-source contributions**: I've contributed to several projects like [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes), [Docker](https://github.com/docker), [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci), [ONOS](https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos), [GoogleContainerTools](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools), [Hasura](https://github.com/hasura), [Celery](https://github.com/celery), and [TektonCD](https://github.com/tektoncd).
- **Global HTTPS Redirect Service**: Architected a globally distributed HTTPS redirect product handling over **1 million certificate** renewals and **thousands of redirects per second** with horizontal scaling on Kubernetes (Go, Kubernetes, Kafka, Vault, ACME protocol).
- **Kubernetes Infrastructure Automation**: Led the automation and standardization of Kubernetes infrastructure across **30+ clusters**, enabling multi-region continuous deployments and GitOps secrets management, improving **deployment speed by 99%**, from days to seconds (ArgoCD, SOPS, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse).
- **Database Optimization**: Achieved up to **1000x performance improvements** through database optimizations and zero-downtime migrations between different systems, e.g. row-based, column-based, doc-based, to maximize performance (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, DynamoDB).
- **Microservices Migration**: Directed the migration of legacy monolithic applications to microservices-based architectures in multiple companies, improving scalability and fault tolerance (Kubernetes).
- **ARTEMIS Project**: Developed ARTEMIS, an open-source tool for real-time defense against BGP hijacking, leading to the formation of a startup that was later acquired by Cisco (Python, BGP, Security, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis).
