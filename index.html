- Led end-to-end execution of projects, from architecture design to implementation, deployment, and monitoring, including but not limited to [DNSSEC](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/aiops/blogs/nathanael-jean-francois/2023/10/03/ns1s-journey-to-dnssec) service, [Zone Version](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ns1-connect?topic=zones-zone-versioning-backup-restore) service, [Monitoring](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ns1-connect?topic=monitoring-managing-ns1-jobs) service.
- Improved the database and API performance (100-1000x) by analyzing and optimizing Postgresql bottlenecks.
- Incident commander in multiple (>10) Sev1 incidents.
- Developed full-stack features while introducing new technologies to strengthen our architecture, such as Kafka, Debezium, PostgreSQL as a queue, monoliths to micro-services refactoring and more.
- Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams‚ÄîProduct, Frontend, Design, and QA‚Äîto drive success across multiple initiatives while facilitating cross-team collaboration to address critical issues and ensure smooth operations.
